The corrected CSS code addresses the order of operations issue using parentheses and ensures consistent units.

```css
div {
  width: calc((100% + 20px) * 2);
  /* Correct use of parenthesis */
  height: calc(100px + 50%); /*Consistent units*/
}
```

This version ensures that the addition is performed before the multiplication, producing the correct width.  It also ensures consistent use of units to prevent errors.
